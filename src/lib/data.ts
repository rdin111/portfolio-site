        description: 'This project is a full-stack, real-time Kanban board called Flowboard, designed from the ground up for seamless workflow visualization and multi-user collaboration. Built on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) with TypeScript, the application allows users to manage multiple project boards, lists, and cards with complete CRUD functionality. The core user experience is centered around a polished drag-and-drop interface (dnd-kit) for intuitively reordering both tasks and lists. Real-time synchronization is powered by a WebSocket (Socket.io) backend with a room-based architecture, ensuring that changes made by one user are instantly reflected for all others. To enhance productivity, the application integrates Google\'s Gemini AI via a secure backend proxy, allowing users to auto-generate entire task lists from a single natural language prompt. The entire application is deployed with a Node.js backend on Render and a responsive, themeable React frontend on Vercel.',
